# Vue 3 + Typescript + Vite + Quasar + Tailwindcss + Pinia

Quick start with vue3  
Build for PC & Mobile Application

## Vue3

Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and provides a declarative and component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be it simple or complex.

## Vite

Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:

- A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

- A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

Vite is opinionated and comes with sensible defaults out of the box, but is also highly extensible via its Plugin API and JavaScript API with full typing support.

You can learn more about the rationale behind the project in the [Why Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html) section.

## Quasar

Quasar (pronounced /ˈkweɪ.zɑɹ/) is an MIT licensed open-source Vue.js based framework, which allows you as a web developer to quickly create responsive++ websites/apps in many flavours:

- SPAs (Single Page App)
- SSR (Server-side Rendered App) (+ optional PWA client takeover)
- PWAs (Progressive Web App)
- BEX (Browser Extension)
- Mobile Apps (Android, iOS, …) through Cordova or Capacitor
- Multi-platform Desktop Apps (using Electron)

Quasar’s motto is: write code once and simultaneously deploy it as a website, a Mobile App and/or an Electron App. Yes, one codebase for all of them, helping you develop an app in record time by using a state-of-the-art CLI and backed by best-practice, blazing fast Quasar web components.

When using Quasar, you won’t need additional heavy libraries like Hammer.js, Moment.js or Bootstrap. It’s got those needs covered internally, and all with a small footprint!

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.

It's fast, flexible, and reliable — with zero-runtime.

## Pinia

Pinia is a store library for Vue, it allows you to share a state across components/pages. If you are familiar with the Composition API, you might be thinking you can already share a global state with a simple export const state = reactive({}). This is true for single page applications but exposes your application to security vulnerabilities if it is server side rendered. But even in small single page applications, you get a lot from using Pinia:

- Devtools support
  - A timeline to track actions, mutations
  - Stores appear in components where they are used
  - Time travel and easier debugging
- Hot module replacement
  - Modify your stores without reloading your page
  - Keep any existing state while developing
- Plugins: extend Pinia features with plugins
- Proper TypeScript support or autocompletion for JS users
- Server Side Rendering Support
